My Name is Rahul Singh.

I am a researcher with background in progressive damage modelling, composites, and impact/blast loading.

## My Projects

### Impact and blast analysis of a plate in thermal environment (Master's Dissertation)
- Micro-mechanics based elastic-plastic response of fiber reinforced composites with strain rate dependent modeling using VUMAT subroutine in ABAQUS for impact and blast loading ([read more](http://tinyurl.com/blastanalysis)). 
- Development of user interface using Python to link ABAQUS with the optimizer to optimize composite laminates under various loading conditions. 
- Bio-inspired stacking sequence for fiber reinforced composites. 
- Recipient of Student Research Program grant (ORSP/R\&D/PDPU/2017/RDNP) to build ballistic impact experimental setup at Dept. of Mechanical Engg, PDPU, Gandhinagar for the year 2017-2018. 
- Manufacturing of Composite specimens using hand layup technique for testing in ballistic impact loading setup built from the research grant.
